# FFMpeg-Batch
The Repository contains of scripts that allow batch conversion of media files using ffmpeg.

FFMpeg is free software providing tools to handle multimedia codecs, streaming, conversion and recording.
But in order to use it people have to deal with command line interface or to rely on other gui tools. 

Its ok for experts but amatures find difficult to use it. To make it easier for amatures the repository provides batch scripts.

1. Configure FFMpeg in windows using seps given at http://goo.gl/5oUPxZ
2. Download the repository or particular batch file.
3. Copy the Video/audio/image files and chosen script to same directory.
4. Run the batch by double clicking.
5. Once compression completes the resulting files can be seen by grouping with file type.
